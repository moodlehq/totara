UPGRADING A MOODLE SITE TO TOTARA
=================================

These instructions detail the process for upgrading a Moodle site to Totara.

NOTE: Additional plugins, custom themes or customised Moodle code are likely to
    cause conflicts in the upgrade process.
    Review possible conflicts before upgrading to prevent site stability issues.
    Ensure the Moodle site is updated to Moodle version 1.9.11 before upgrading.

    Proceed with upgrades at your own risk.

    For more information see http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading

1.  Check the live logs to check if any users are currently using the site.
    The site will be offline while the upgrades are performed.
    Reports -> Live Logs

2.  Enable maintenance mode in Moodle.
    Server -> Maintenance Mode

3.  Backup the Moodle database.

4.  Backup the moodledata directory.

5.  Backup the Moodle source code directory.

6.  Merge the existing Moodle source code and new Totara code. This is best
    accomplished using a version control tool like GIT or SVN. You will
    need to:
    - Reuse the existing Moodle's config.php file
    - Ensure any themes are updated to work with Totara
    - Include any existing modules and filters remain in the code
    - Resolve any merge conflicts caused by existing local customisations

7.  Navigate to admin/index.php using a web browser and perform the install process.

8.  Click Yes on the Upgrade page.

9. Confirm the server status checks.

10. Confirm the plugin status checks.

11. Proceed with the initial database upgrades.

12. Edit the New Admin Settings page if required.

13. Continue the database upgrades.

14. Check for Warnings or Errors on the upgrade review page.

15. Edit the New Site Settings page if required.

16. Test the site functionality. The site should now be displayed with the
    Totara logos and theme.

17. Disable server maintenance mode.

18. Congratulations, your site is now running Totara.
