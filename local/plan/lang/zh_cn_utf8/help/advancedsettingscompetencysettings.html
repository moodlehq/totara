<p>Select the <strong>&lsquo;Due dates&rsquo;</strong> setting. When <strong>&lsquo;Due dates&rsquo;</strong> is set to &lsquo;None&rsquo; the column does not appear on the learning plan.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>&lsquo;Priorities&rsquo; </strong>setting. When you are using <strong>&lsquo;Priorities&rsquo;</strong> you need a <strong>&lsquo;Priority Scale&rsquo;</strong>. Click the dropdown menu to select the priority scale.</p>
<strong> Note: </strong>The option to set up such a scale is in Learning Plans&gt;Priority Scales.
<p><strong>Automatic assignment </strong>enables you to automatically display competencies in a learning plan which have previously been assigned to a user&rsquo;s position or organisation. </p>
