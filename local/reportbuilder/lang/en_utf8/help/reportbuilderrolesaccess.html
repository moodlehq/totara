<h1>Report Builder: Roles with Access</h1>

<p>If Access controls are set to 'Only certain users can view this report' then this setting is used to determine which roles have access. If the Access controls are set to 'All users can view this report' then this option is disabled and ignored.</p>
<p>A user will be able to view the report, if they have been assigned to one or more of the checked roles at the specified context level. System level roles are assigned by a site administrator.</p>
