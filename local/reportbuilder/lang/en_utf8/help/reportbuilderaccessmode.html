<h1>Report Builder: Access Mode</h1>

<p>Access controls are used to restrict which moodle users are allowed to view the report.</p>
<p>The restrict access option lets you select the overall settings for this report:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All users can view this report<br />No restrictions are applied to the report. All users have permission to view it, and all the following options will be ignored.</li>
    <li>Only certain users can view this report<br />If this option is selected, access to the report is restricted to certain users. The remaining form elements determine exactly who is able to access the report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that access restrictions only control who can view the report, not which records it contains. See the content tab for controlling the report contents.</p>
