<h1>Report Builder: Show by current organisation</h1>

<p>This criteria is enabled by selecting the 'Show records from staff in the user's organisation' checkbox. If selected, then the report will show different records depending on which part of the organisation the person viewing the report is in. This is determined by the settings in the 'Positions' tab in their user profile.</p>
<p>'Include records from child organisations' determines which records the user sees:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set to 'no':<br />The viewer of the report sees all records for users who are currently in the same organisation as themselves.</li>
    <li>Set to 'yes':<br />The same as above, but the viewer of the report also sees records for users whos organisation lies <em>below</em> the viewer's organisation in the organisation hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
