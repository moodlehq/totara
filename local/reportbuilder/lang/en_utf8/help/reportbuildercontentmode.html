<h1>Report Builder: Content Mode</h1>

<p>Content controls are used to restrict the records that are available when the report is viewed. This allows you to produce reports that are tailored to a particular set of users (for instance a manager can only see records for his staff), or show only certain information (for instance a report may only show historical records).</p>
<p>The report content option lets you select the overall settings for this report:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Show all records<br />If this option is selected, every available record for this source will be shown, and all the following options will be ignored.</li>
    <li>Show records matching <strong>any</strong> of the checked criteria<br />If this option is selected, the records shown will be restricted. Records that match any of the selected criteria will be shown. Only options that are enabled (by checking the first checkbox in the section) will be considered. If no criteria are enabled the report will not match any records, so it will show zero results.</li>
    <li>Show records matching <strong>all</strong> of the checked criteria<br />If this option is selected, the records shown will be restricted. Only records that match all of the selected criteria will be shown. Only options that are enabled (by checking the first checkbox in the section) will be applied. If no options are checked the report will not match any records, so it will show zero results.</li>
</ul>
