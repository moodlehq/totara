<p>These checkboxes determine which users are able to view this report, and also determine which records the user is able to see.</p>
<p>The options available will depend on the source of the report, but may include some of the following:</p>
<p><strong>Self</strong><br />
The report viewer will be able to see there own records, as long as they have the 'viewownreports' capability is enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>Direct Reports</strong><br />
The report viewer will be able to see records for any users for whom they are assigned as manager, as long as they
have the 'viewstaffreports' capability. Manager assignment is done via the Positions Tab on the users profile page.
</p>
<p><strong>Current Local Staff</strong><br />
This setting allows the report viewer to view records for a particular subset of the organisation. In order to view these records the
report viewer must have the 'viewlocalreports' capability. Then, the records that are shown depend on the users current 'organisation'
setting (assigned via the Positions Tab on the user profile page). The report viewer will see records for any staff members whose
current organisation is the same as the report viewers <i>and</i> any staff whose organisation is a subsiduary of the report viewers
organisation.
</p>
<p><strong>Those completed locally</strong><br />
This setting is similar to 'Current Local Staff', and requires the same 'viewlocalreports' capability. The difference is that this
setting shows records that were marked as completed in the report viewers organisation (or subsiduary). I.e. the records shown
depend on the organisation at time of completion, not the users current organisation setting. In most cases selecting both 'Current
Local Staff' and 'Those completed locally' will display the results you want.
</p>
<p><strong>All records (admin only)</strong><br />
This setting will allow a user with the 'viewallreports' capability to view every record available to this report. Usually only
administrators will be given the 'viewallreports' capability, but you should be careful to check that if you check this option and
the data contained within the report is sensitive.
</p>
<p><strong>All records (no restrictions)</strong><br />
This option makes all the reports records available to all users without any capability requirements. Be very careful in selecting
this option if the records contain sensitive information!
