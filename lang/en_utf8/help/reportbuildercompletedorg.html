<h1>Report Builder: Show by completed organisation</h1>

<p>This criteria is enabled by selecting the 'Show records completed in the user's organisation' checkbox. If selected, then the report will show different records depending on which part of the organisation the person viewing the report is in. This is determined by the settings in the 'Positions' tab in their user profile.</p>
<p>'Include records from child organisations' determines which records the user sees:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set to 'no':<br />The viewer of the report sees all records which were completed in the same organisation as the viewer is currently in.</li>
    <li>Set to 'yes':<br />The same as above, but the viewer of the report also sees records that were completed in organisations that lie <em>below</em> the viewer's organisation in the organisation hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
